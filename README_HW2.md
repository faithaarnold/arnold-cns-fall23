## Docker Images
### Busybox
Busybox is an open-source docker image container. It is lightweight and extremely minimalistic, making it ideal for those only looking to use basic tasks such as file manipulation, shell scripting, and networking. Because of its minimalist functionality, it is much more size efficient in comparison to other containers. Despite its highly minimalistic qualities, this container still allows for cusotmization so the user can choose which utilities are to be included in the image. For my submssion of HW2, I chose Busybox as my image container.
### Debian
Debian is an open-source project under the Debian Project, which is a community-driven organization. Debian has a wide selection of pre-built packages which allows for tons of versatility in building applications within the container. This container allows the addition of other software and configurations to meet the needs of the application. Additionally, the Debian community is active in documentiation and helping other users, making it easy to find assistance in using the container.
